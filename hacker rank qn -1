1.In this challenge, you must read an integer, a double, and a String from stdin, then print the values according to the instructions in the Output Format section below. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor.

Note: We recommend completing Java Stdin and Stdout I before attempting this challenge.

Input Format

There are three lines of input:

1.The first line contains an integer.
2.The second line contains a double.
3.The third line contains a String.


  import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();
        double d = scan.nextDouble();
        scan.nextLine();
        String s = scan.nextLine();

        // Write your code here.

        System.out.println("String: " + s);
        System.out.println("Double: " + d);
        System.out.println("Int: " + i);
    }
}

2.Task
Given an integer, n , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If  n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  6 to 20 , print Weird
If  n is even and greater than 20 , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

     private static final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = scanner.nextInt();

        if (N % 2 != 0) {
            System.out.print("Weird");
        } else if (N >= 2 && N <= 5) {
            System.out.print("Not Weird");
        } else if (N >= 6 && N <= 20) {
            System.out.print("Weird");
        } else {
            System.out.print("Not Weird");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
